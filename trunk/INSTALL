    INSTALLATION
    -Pre-requisites
        1)OpenDX:
		DXStereo is an OpenDX module, so you need OpenDX installed before
		you can use it. Your copy of OpenDX can be installed from source
		or from binary packages. If the last is the case, you must install
		also OpenDX development packages.
		(Tested with OpenDX version 4.3 and 4.4)
        2)GLUT:
		DXStereo is implemented in C and requires the GLUT library,
		which requires OpenGL and GLU.
		(Tested with FreeGLUT 2.4)
            
        3)GCC:
		You need an ANSI C compiler.
		(Tested with GCC 3.x and 4.x)

    -Compile
	DXStereo includes a makefile with the next list of targets:
		1) 'dxstereo' (outboard)
		2) 'dxexec' (inboard)
		3) 'run'
		4) 'run_outboard'
		5) 'clean'
	To build dxstereo you just need to employ 'make' with one of the targets
	'dxexec' if you want DXStereo to be build as an inboard module or 'dxstereo'
	if you need it as outboard module.
	Example:
        	$make dxexec

    -Run
	You can employ the targets 'run' in case you have build DXStereo as inboard
	or 'run_outboard' in other case.
	Example:
		$make run
